                <p>A small-town incident in a Boston suburb captivates the media. Sandra Jones,
                    a young schoolteacher and model mother, has vanished. The sole witness:

                    The moment Inspector D.D. Warren steps into the Jones' home, she senses
                    something amiss: Jason's reluctance to answer her questions, his lack of
                    urgency in uncovering what happened to his beloved wife... Is he trying to
                    throw off the trail, or is he shielding his daughter? But..</p>
